## Weeks 1 - 6 - Computational Thinking

During these initial 6 weeks we learnt.... During that time I learnt ... This has been of great benefit because .... 

 - Learning to code in python
 - Thinking computationaly



## Weeks 6 - 12 Cyber Security (the fun stuff)

### Week 2 - Security Information and Event Managament (SIEM)

We were given a hands on experience with Splunk, a leading tool in the SIEM workspace. It can be used to aggregate and interrogate data and is a commonly used tool in SoCs (Security Operations Centers). We used datasets from the BoSS of the SoC (add link here) that provideed real world sceanrios for us to practice with. This gave us an insight into the working world of a SoC analyst and the tools that we could expect to use in such a position. 

I found the ability to quickly and efficiently draw pertient data from the dataset provided was exceptionally useful and show cases how important .... 

We can became very familiar with [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).
